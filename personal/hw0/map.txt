• Use objdump with the -D flag on the map executable. Which of the addresses from the output of running ./map are defined in the executable, and which segment/section is each defined in?
  _main  @ 0x4005c2 in .text section
  recur @ 0x40057d  in .text section
  static data: 0x601048	     in .text section

• Make a list of the important segments, and what they are used for (look up their names on the Internet if you don’t know).
  .text	       - assembly code
  .bss - uninitialized global variables
  .data	 - static variables
  .rodata - read-only data
  .interp - file name of the dynamic linker

• What direction is the stack growing in?
  The stack is growing downwards (higher address to lower address).

• How large is the stack frame for each recursive call?
  48 bytes.

• Where is the heap? What direction is it growing in?
  The heap is at 0x671010. It's growing upwards.

• Are the two malloc()ed memory areas contiguous? (e.g. is there any extra space between their addresses?)
  They are not contiguous. There are 112 bytes between them.
